# ML-Ops-Final
final project

Proposed Model Functionality:
Slice Creation:
- HDRs for numeric feature slices - in progress, Ziv
- Decision Trees for categorical feature slices
- Creating slice combinations - done, Ziv
Determining Problematic Slices:
- Define minimal support
- Define statistically significant - in progress, Ziv
- Extracting problematic slices based on minimal support and statistical significance -  in progress, Ziv
Updating Dataset Based on Problematic Slices
- Data Generation (explore using GAN, SMOTE, or duplication)
Retraining
Compare Model Performance

Notes
- Need to include validation set in data split so that there remains a test set that was unobserved after the retraining
