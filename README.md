# ML-Ops-Final

## Proposed Model Functionality:   
### Slice Creation:   
- HDRs for numeric feature slices
- Creating slice combinations with fature values and HDRs
- Decision Trees for combined categorical and numeric feature slices

### Determining Problematic Slices:   
- Define minimal support
- Define statistically significant
- Extracting problematic slices based on minimal support and statistical significance

### Updating Dataset Based on Problematic Slices   
- Data Generation (explore using GAN, SMOTE, or duplication)    

### Retraining    

### Compare Model Performance    

### Notes
- Need to include validation set in data split so that there remains a test set that was unobserved after the retraining

## Written Project Components   
### Fixed Mid-Term report (with comments addressed)   
### Baseline Report   
### Model Report (including target metrtic comparison to the baseline model)   
### Final Report (including any diffs from the original design and rationale)   
### Presentation
